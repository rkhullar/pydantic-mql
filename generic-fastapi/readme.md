## Generic FastAPI

This project demonstrates how to use `nydev-fastapi-tools` to create a generic backend to store
data in MongoDB Atlas. From the openapi docs users first login through Auth0. Then users can manage
their own arbitrary data, or they can read shared data. Admins can manage the shared data.
